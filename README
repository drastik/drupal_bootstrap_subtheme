The script is very basic, for my own needs.

It makes a few assumptions:
This script assumes these paths exist:  
- themes/contrib/bootstrap/starterkits/cdn
- themes/custom/your_theme_name (will be created)

It only copies the CDN version.  It would be easy to add a 3rd arugment to allow it to copy LESS or SASS.
I just don't need those at the moment.
